Metrics Server:
-You can have one metrics server per kubernetes cluster.
-the metric server retrieves metrics from each of the kubernetes nodes and pods, aggregates them and stores them in memory.
-Note that the metric server is only an in memory monitoring solution and does not store the metrics on the desk and as a result you cannot see historical  
 performance data.
So how are the metrics generated for the PODs on these nodes? 
-Kubernetes runs an agent on each node known as the kubelet, which is responsible for receiving instructions from the kubernetes API master server and 
 running PODs on the nodes.The kubelet also contains a subcomponent known as as cAdvisor or Container Advisor.
-cAdvisor is responsible for retrieving performance metrics from pods, and exposing them through the kubelet API to make the metrics available for the 
 Metrics Server
 
Command to view memory and CPU consumption of each nodes,pods
- watch "kubectl top node" / kubectl top node
- kubectl top pod
