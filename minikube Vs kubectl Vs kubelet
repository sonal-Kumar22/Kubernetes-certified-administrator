- kubectl is a “client-side” tool (binary executable) that can connect to a kubernetes cluster to read, create, modify well known kubernetes resources 
(like pod, deployment, services)
- kubelet is a part of the kubernetes cluster (server) software. It runs on worker nodes of a kubernetes cluster. It sees what pods needs to be realized on 
a node and realizes them in the form of running docker containers. As such it talks a lot to the docker layer on the node.
- minikube is a way to setup a 1 noded kubernetes cluster running in a VM on top of a host (for example your own laptop). It is used to learn kubernetes. 
Production systems should use kubernetes clusters with 3 master nodes to acchieve high availability.
