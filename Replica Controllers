Controllers: 
They are the brain behind kubernetes. They are processes that monitor kubernetes objects (pod,node..) and respond accordingly.
Replication Controller : 
It helps us run multiple instances of a single pod in kubernetes cluster by running multiple pods thus providing high availability.
Even if we have a single pod, replication controller can still help by bringing up new pod in place of failed pod.
It also helps in load balancingpo and scaling.
They can also monitor existing PODs.

Replication Controller is replaced by replica set.
Commands:
1.create replication controller using YAML file : kubectl create -f replicationControlelr.yaml
2.view replication controller created along with total replicas : kubectl get replicationcontroller
3.To update the file content we use command after doing changes in the file : 
kubectl replace -f filename.yml
or 
kubectl scale --replicas=6 -f filename.yml (for this we need not modify the file,it'll be done through command line)
or
kubectl scale --replicas=6 replicaset myapp-replicaset(name) (for this we need not modify the file,it'll be done through command line)
4.delete replica sets: kubectl delete replicaset replicaset-name 
(it deletes all underlying PODs)
5.Command to edit replicaset file : kubectl edit replicaset new-replica-set(replicaset name)

YAML file to create replicaset:
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: replicaset-2
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      tier: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        tier: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
