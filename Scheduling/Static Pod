The kubelet relies on the kube-apiserver for instructions on what PODs to load on its node,which was based on a decision made by the kube-scheduler which
was stored in the ETCD datastore.
What if there was no kube-apiserver, and kube-scheduler and no controllers and no ETCD cluster.

What if there was no master at all.

What if there were no other nodes.

What if you're all alone in the sea by yourself.

Not part of any cluster.

Is there anything that the kubelet can do as the captain on the ship?

Can it operate as an independent node?

If so who would provide the instructions required to create PODs?

The one thing that the kubelet knows to do is create PODs. But we donâ€™t have an API server here to provide POD details.
By now we know that to create a POD you need the details of the POD in a POD definition file. But how

do you provide a pod definition file to the kubelet without a kube-api server?

You can configure the kubelet to read the pod definition files from a directory on the server designated to store information about pods.
the Kubelet periodically checks this directory for files reads these files and creates pods on the host.

So these PODs that are created by the kubelet on its own without the intervention from the API server or rest of the kuberentes cluster components are 
known as Static PODs.

Remember you can only create PODs this way.You cannot create replicasets or deployments or services by placing a definition file in the designated 
directory.
The kubelet works at a POD level and can only understand PODs. Which is why it is able to create static pods.

So what is that designated folder

and how do you configure it.

It could be any directory on the host. And the location of that directory is passed in to the kubelet

as a option while running the service.

The option is named pod manifest path

and here it is set to /etc/Kubernetes/manifests. 

Q)How many static pods exist in this cluster in all namespaces?
