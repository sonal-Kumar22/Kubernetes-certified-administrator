Manually schedule the pod on node01
Delete and recreate the POD if necessary.
- kubectl delete pod nginx
- vi nginx.yaml 
YAML File:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  nodeName: node01
  containers:
  -  image: nginx
     name: nginx
     
- kubectl create -f nginx.yaml
- kubectl get pod

Note: the scheduler does not schedule any any part in the master node because when kubernetes cluster is first setup it sets a taint on master node 
      which prevents any pods from being scheduled on this master node
      Command to view this taint : 
      - kubectl describe node kubemaster | grep Taint
