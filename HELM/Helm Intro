HELM Introduction:

HELM:
- its a kubernetes based package installer
- best way to find , share and use software build for kubernetes
- helps user to maintain application
- helm is managed by CNCF - Cloud Native Computing Fiundation
- helm manages kubernetes charts which are preconfigured packages of kubernetes resources
- it enabled you to easily install packages , install revisions, and even rollback complex changes

Why we need helm:
- helm lets you deploy, fetch and manage application lifecycle both 3rd party products and your own
- with helm, there is a structure and convention for a software package that defines a layer of YAML templates and another layer that changes the templates 
  called values.
- Values are injected into templates thus allowing a separation of configuration and defines where chages are allowed
- this whole package is called helm chart
- essentially you create strucutred application packages that contain everything they need to run a kubernetes cluster including dependencies the 
  application requires.

HEML CLI or Tiller
- Helm is a CLI tool that interacts with its backend server called tiller
- tiller is installed by sending the command helm-init and lives in the kube-system namespace
- when a chart is installed tiller creates a 'release' and starts tracking it for changes.
- this way helm not only takes part in installation but is an actual deploy tool that manages lifecycle of applications in a cluster using chart release 
  and their revisions.
